# macroquad_arkanoid
A simple arakanoid/breakout game made in [marcoquad](https://macroquad.rs/). I made this by watching TanTan's tutorial on making one, then tried to make it by myself. If you want to original one:
https://github.com/TanTanDev/breakout_tutorial

Mine lacks a lot of things, beacuse i simply wanted to get the main parts of the game done and learn about the library.
And yes, i had to copy the math part because i didnt understand it very well.

## Updates
I might eventually update it here and there and fix the bad code. I wont do anything about it for a while.

## Warning
Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and Cargo installed on your local machine.
The Project is missing a lot of features
