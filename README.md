# macroquad_arkaniod
A simple arakanoid/breakout game made in marcoquad. I made this by watching TanTan's tutorial on making one, then tried to make it by myself. If you want to original one:
https://github.com/TanTanDev/breakout_tutorial

Mine lacks a lot of things, beacuse i simply wanted to get the main parts of the game done and learn about the library.
